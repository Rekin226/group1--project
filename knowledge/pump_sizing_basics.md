# Aquaponics Pump Sizing Basics

## Core rule of thumb
- Start with a target of about **1x system water turnover per hour** as a baseline.
- Adjust upward for higher stocking density, long pipe runs, or high head height.

## Important: rated flow vs actual flow
- Pump labels are often measured at **zero head**.
- Real flow drops when water is lifted vertically (head height) and when pipes have bends/restrictions.

## Practical recommendation framework
1. Measure **vertical head height** (pump to highest outlet).
2. Estimate desired circulation flow (system turnover target).
3. Check the pump curve and confirm flow at your measured head height.
4. Add **20-50% capacity margin** for losses and future expansion.

## Quick checks before buying a bigger pump
- Clean pump intake / filter sponge
- Check pipe clogs, biofilm, and kinks
- Check valve position and outlet restrictions
- Do a bucket test to estimate actual flow

## Bucket test (simple flow estimate)
- Fill a known-volume bucket and time it.
- Flow (L/min) = bucket volume (L) / fill time (min)
- Convert to L/h by multiplying by 60
