# Fish Moving Slowly / Eating Less (Troubleshooting)

## Possible causes
- Low dissolved oxygen (DO)
- Ammonia / nitrite stress
- Temperature stress
- Recent system changes (water change, chemicals, pump failure, power outage)
- Overfeeding or poor water circulation

## Immediate safe actions
- Increase aeration
- Check water circulation and pump output
- Reduce feeding for 12-24 hours if fish show stress
- Observe for gasping, flashing, clamped fins, or mortality

## Follow-up questions
- Water temperature?
- pH?
- Any recent changes?
- Flow rate / pump condition?
- Ammonia / nitrite if available?
