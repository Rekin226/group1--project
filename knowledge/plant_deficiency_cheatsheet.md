# Lettuce Yellowing (Quick Differential)

## Common causes
- Iron deficiency (new leaves may yellow first)
- Nitrogen deficiency (older leaves yellowing)
- Low flow / poor root oxygen
- Root disease / slime / foul smell
- pH lockout (nutrients present but not available)

## What to check
- pH trend (not just one reading)
- Nitrate level
- Root appearance (white vs brown/slimy)
- Flow consistency to grow channels/bed
- Water temperature and dissolved oxygen (if available)

## Safe first actions
- Improve aeration
- Check and restore stable flow
- Reduce feeding slightly if fish are stressed
- Inspect roots and remove dead tissue if needed
