# Aquaponics Quick Water Quality Ranges (General Baseline)

## Note
Ranges vary by species and system design. Use species-specific targets when possible.

## Common baseline checks
- pH: often managed around a middle range that balances fish, plants, and nitrifying bacteria
- Temperature: species-dependent (tilapia warmer than trout)
- Ammonia/Nitrite: keep as low as possible
- Nitrate: usually tolerated better than ammonia/nitrite, but extremes can still indicate imbalance
- Dissolved oxygen: maintain strong aeration, especially in warm water

## Stability matters
A stable system is usually better than rapid corrections. Avoid large sudden changes unless emergency conditions are present.
